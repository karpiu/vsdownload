  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clitic/vsdownload/main/images/gui_wrapper.jpg">
</p>

To use gui wrapper, first install PyQt6 and then run **vsdownload-gui**

```bash
$ pip install PyQt6
$ vsdownload-gui
```

## Scripting And Automation

You can also integrate vsdownload save and capture command in any python program. This is useful when you have to automate or create sub website m3u8 downloaders. First you can find or parse the m3u8 uri from a website then call `vsdownload.save()` function in order to download it.

- save command function

```python
from vsdownload import vsdownload

vsdownload.save("http://videoserver.com/playlist.m3u8", output="merged.mp4")
```

- capture and save command functions

```python
from vsdownload import vsdownload

log_file = "stream_log.json"

vsdownload.capture("http://streamingsite.com/stream.html", "chromedriver.exe", output=log_file)
vsdownload.save(log_file, output="merged.mp4")
```

- calling vsdownload through subprocess

```python
import subprocess

command_args = [
  "vsdownload", # command
  "save", # sub command
  "http://videoserver.com/playlist.m3u8", # input
  "-o", # extra options
  "a.mp4" # output file
]

try:
  subprocess.run(command_args, check=True)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
  print(f"error code: {e.returncode}")
```
